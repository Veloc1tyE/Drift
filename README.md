# Drift
Reinforcement Learning for Fusion Control. This library will be built on top of the BOUT++ open-source fusion simulation project, and will contain all necessary functionality for training reinforcement learning agents to control and sustain fusion reactions, while preventing the formation of various associated instabilities.
